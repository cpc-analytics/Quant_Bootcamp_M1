## Objects in R{.scrollable}

+ [The most common type of object in R is `vector`]{.fragment fragment-index="1"}

+ [Vectors can store all types of data: integers, characters, logical]{.fragment fragment-index="2"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index="3"}
```{r vector_integer}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true

id <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
id
```
:::

+ [Similarly, another vector with characters can be made]{.fragment fragment-index="4"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index="5"}
```{r vector_character}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true

name <- c("John", "Mary", "Cal", "Jess","Sam")
name
```
:::

## Objects in R{.scrollable}

+ [Factor object encodes a vector of unique elements into levels]{.fragment fragment-index="1"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index="2"}
```{r vector_factors}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true

score <- c("Very Bad", "Bad", "Neutral", "Good","Very Good")
print(factor(score))
```
:::

+ [Can you try making a vector called `age` with 5 values?]{.fragment fragment-index="3"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index="4"}
```{r vector_age}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true

age <- c(19, 21, 15, 25,23)
age
```
:::

## Objects in R{.scrollable}

+ Dataframes are tabular data objects
+ Each column in a dataframe is a vector
+ You can create a dataframe using the vectors you just created

```{r vector_dataframe}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true

dataframe1 <- data.frame(id, name, score, age)
dataframe1
```

**What?**

+ For organising files in a project
+ A tool to track your project

> In their own words, [RStudio](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects) projects make it straightforward to divide your work into multiple contexts, each with their own working directory, workspace, history, and source documents

**Why**

+ Although R keeps track of various different events that have happened but it has no idea which events are associated with  particular project

+ ***Convenience***
  - Keeps things tidy and smooths the process
+ ***Functionality***
  - An RStudio project creates a `.Rproj` file that links the different scripts, data sets, etc within a particular folder on your computer
  - Also makes it easier to share code with others

**How?**

::: panel-tabset

### 1. Create Project

Go to the the little blue menu in the top the top right corner in RStudio, click on the dropdown menu, and select 'New Project'

![](https://becker.wustl.edu/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2021-04-29-at-12.02.40-PM.png)

### 2. Select Directory

You can either:

+ Choose to open a project in a new directory
+ Or choose to work in an existing directory

![](https://www.rstudio.com/images/docs/projects_new.png)

### 3. Voilà!

Once you’ve created the project, if you have a look at the folder in Windows Explorer / Mac Finder in the respective directory, you’ll see your file!

## Packages and Libraries{.scrollable}

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}

+ When using R, you will be writing functions to perform operations
+ Essentially, a package is a collection of functions
+ You need to install a package only once using `install.package`
+ However, you need to `load` it every session
